# MATLAB: General Purpose MATLAB Files Applicable Anywhere

This repository serves as a collection of my **general-purpose MATLAB functions, scripts, and utilities** that are broadly useful across different contexts.  

These files are **not specific to any particular project or laboratory** — they are meant to provide reusable, standalone functionality for a variety of applications.

> **Note:** Code and scripts that are specific to **RRG** are stored separately in that repository, under its `MATLAB/` subdirectory.
